<b>Hello my Friend</b> 

This bot gives you access to OpenAI products such as ChatGPT and Dall-E to create text and images.

‚ö°Bot uses the same model as ChatGPT: gpt-3.5-turbo.

The chat bot is able to:
1. Write and edit texts
2. Translate from any language to any language
3. Write and edit code
Answering questions

You can communicate with the bot as with a live interlocutor by asking questions in any language. Note that sometimes the bot makes up facts and has limited knowledge about events after 2021.

‚úâÔ∏è To get a text response, just chat your question.
 
üîÑ To remove the dialog context, use the command /clean_context.

üí¨ If you have any questions or suggestions, email admin @yair770.
